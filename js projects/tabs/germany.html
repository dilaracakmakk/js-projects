                        <p>
                            Rouladen is a classic and favorite German meal. 
                            The precise origin of the dish is unknown, however it is known that the dish originated in Europe and the word “roulade” originates from the word “rouler” in French which means “to roll.” 
                            Rouladen was once considered so special that it was served only on Sundays or on special occasions.
                            Now they are a traditional dinner choice, served throughout Germany at any time of the week, or year, but especially during the autumn and winter months. 
                            Rouladen is popular as a laid back comfort food for the harsh German winters.  In some countries, the roulade is also known as “beef olive”.

                        <p>
                            Spread 1/2 tablespoon mustard over one side of each piece of steak; sprinkle onion, paprika, salt, and pepper evenly over the steaks. 
                            Lay one slice of bacon on each piece; roll up steaks jelly roll-style and secure with toothpicks.
                            Heat canola oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook beef rouladen on all sides until browned. 
                            Add broth and water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until tender, about 30 minutes.
                            Remove beef rouladen; strain broth mixture and return liquid to the skillet. 
                            Whisk cornstarch and 1 cup of water together until smooth; slowly pour cornstarch mixture into the skillet, stirring continually until the sauce has thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. 
                            Stir in sour cream; return rolls to the sauce and serve immediately.
