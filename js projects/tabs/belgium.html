                        <p>
                            One of the most popular meals in Belgium is a potato-based side dish known as stoemp. It consists of mashed potatoes enhanced by the addition of other vegetables such as carrots and leeks. They are boiled or fried, mixed, and then puréed with mashed potatoes.

                            Optional ingredients include fried onions, shallots, bacon, or various herbs. Stoemp has been present in Belgian cuisine since the 19th century, and it is believed that it was developed during the times of hardship when meat was scarce, and leftover food was used to prepare new, tasty meals.
                            
                            Today, stoemp can be found in numerous Belgian restaurants, but it is also traditionally made at home to complement the main dish. Belgians prefer to eat stoemp alongside sausages, but it is also often served as an accompaniment to chicken, pork, lamb, and even meatballs.

                            <li>2 pounds idaho potatoes, about 5 potatoes.</li>
                            <li>2 carrots, peeled and chopped.</li>
                            <li>10 oz Brussels sprouts.</li>

                            <li>4 tbsp butter.</li>

                        <p>
                            Peel and cube the potatoes. In a large pot, boil the potatoes. When tender, drain and mash.
                            In a separate pan, cook bacon.
                            Cut the leaves off of the leeks and work with the thick part at the bottom. Cut and prepare all vegetables. 
                            In a large pot, melt the butter and add the vegetables. Saute for about 5 minutes.
                            Add stock, cream, nutmeg, salt and pepper.
                            Bring to a boil. When vegetables are cooked, strain liquid out of vegetables and reserve. 
                            Add the vegetables into the potatoes. I added about ¾ of the vegetable mixture and it was enough, but feel free to add as much or as little as you’d like. 
                            Also crumble and add the bacon.
                            Add reserved liquid back into the pan. Reheat to a low boil and cook the sauce, stirring continuously, 
                            until the sauce reduces and becomes thicker.
                            Once sauce is ready, add into the potatoes and mix to combine again. Enjoy!
