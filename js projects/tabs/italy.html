                        <p>
                            Coda all vaccinara was born in the heart of Rome (alla Romana), in the Regola District whose name is derived from renula because of the soft sand (rena) that covered the banks of the Tiber River. 
                            In Ancient Rome this area was said to be consecrated from the god Mars and used to conduct military exercises.
                            The vaccinari were humble slaughterhouses, and it was their job to skin the beasts, in particular the vacche or female bovines that were over three years old.
                             The meat of these Bessie’s was called carne vaccina, a name that carries into today. 
                             The low-ranking butchers were usually paid in offal, which they then sold to local osterias. 
                             The osterias in turn would create original plates with these spare parts, and this is how la coda alla vaccinara was born.

                        <h4>RECIPE</h4>
                       
                        <p>
                            Season the oxtail pieces with a good helping of salt and pepper, then dust with flour. 
                            Sear in a hot pan with some lard or olive oil until browned all over.
                            Remove the oxtail from the pan and set aside. 
                            Add the pancetta, onion, diced celery, carrot and garlic to the pan and sauté until soft.
                            Add the cinnamon, herbs and tomato purée to the pan and stir for 1 minute. 
                            Deglaze with the red wine, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
                            Add the seared oxtail to the pan and let the wine reduce by half. 
                            Add the tinned tomatoes, lengths of celery and enough stock to cover the oxtail.
                            Simmer on a low heat with the lid on for 3 or 4 hours, until the meat is falling away from the bones. 
                            Be sure to check on it occasionally, adding more stock if the meat starts to stick to the pan.
                            Taste, season with salt and pepper and stir in the cocoa powder, if using. 
                            Pick out and discard the cinnamon stick and rosemary and thyme stalks.
                            Serve on a bed of polenta sprinkled with raisins, pine nuts and some of the leaves reserved from the celery sticks.
